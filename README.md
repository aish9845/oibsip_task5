**Sales_prediction_using_python**

This Python project focuses on sales prediction using the scikit-learn library. It begins by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, with 20% reserved for testing and ensuring reproducibility by setting a random seed. 
A Linear Regression model is then created and trained on the training data. The model is used to make predictions on the test data, which are stored in the 'y_predictions' variable. Subsequently, metrics are calculated to evaluate the model's performance. 
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) are computed and printed to assess the accuracy and goodness of fit of the model. 
These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts sales, with lower MAE and RMSE values and a higher R2 indicating a better fit and predictive capability.
